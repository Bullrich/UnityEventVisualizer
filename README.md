<h2>What</h2>
Have you ever come across a project that abuses linking <b>UnityEvents</b> in the inspector and now you can not find who is calling what?
<b>Unity Event Visualizer</b> is a visual tool that allows you to see all the UnityEvents in a scene at a glance and when they are being triggered. It creates a graph in which nodes are <b>gameobjects</b>, outputs are any type of UnityEvent (custom ones supported as well!) and inputs are methods.
